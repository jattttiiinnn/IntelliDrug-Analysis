Title: Field Report – NASH (Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis) Unmet Needs

Date: November 2023
Source: Physician and KOL feedback across 8 major cities

Summary:
Field medical representatives conducted structured interviews with 72 hepatologists and endocrinologists to identify therapeutic gaps in NASH management.

Key Observations:

There remains no approved first-line pharmacologic therapy for NASH.

Physicians are experimenting with off-label GLP-1 analogs (Semaglutide) and PPAR agonists, but with variable success.

Strong preference for oral formulations over injectables, especially in outpatient settings.

Growing awareness of NASH among primary care physicians, but limited diagnostic infrastructure (e.g., FibroScan availability).

Patient Insights:

Many patients discontinue therapy due to weight-gain-related stigma.

Preference for “liver health improvement” framing rather than “NASH treatment.”

Conclusion:
Significant opportunity exists for repurposing metabolic drugs with hepatic benefit. Strategic focus recommended on Semaglutide and Pioglitazone combinations pending trial outcomes.
