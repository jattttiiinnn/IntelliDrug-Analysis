Title: Internal Assessment – Manufacturing Capability (Q2 2024)

Current Capabilities:
Our facility in Ahmedabad is equipped for solid oral dosage and sterile injectable manufacturing. Total installed capacity exceeds 1.8 billion tablets annually with WHO-GMP and USFDA certification.

Molecules Readily Manufacturable:

Metformin Hydrochloride

Sitagliptin

Pioglitazone

Aspirin

Atorvastatin

Partially Supported Molecules:

Semaglutide (requires peptide synthesis capability)

Empagliflozin (requires solvent recovery optimization)

Capacity Constraints:

Limited lyophilization infrastructure for peptide-based injectables.

Current bioreactor utilization at 86%, leaving minimal buffer for scale-up.

Recommendations:

Evaluate CDMO partnerships for peptide manufacturing.

Invest in an additional sterile facility for GLP-1 analog production.

Implement digital predictive maintenance to reduce batch rejections (~1.2% currently).

Conclusion:
Our existing setup is robust for small molecules but needs targeted investment for biologic or peptide-based drug expansion.
