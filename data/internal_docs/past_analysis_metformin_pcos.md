Title: Past Analysis of Metformin for PCOS

Date: April 2022
Outcome: Successful product launch under metabolic women’s health segment

Summary:
This document summarizes our 2022 internal evaluation of Metformin’s use in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The initiative was launched following emerging academic findings linking insulin resistance to PCOS pathogenesis.

Our pharmacology and clinical teams collaborated to repurpose the existing diabetes formulation toward the PCOS indication, focusing on hormonal balance and ovulatory regularity. The study demonstrated consistent metabolic improvement and secondary benefits in weight management.

Key Learnings:

Dose optimization (500–1500 mg daily) was critical to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

Combination therapy with lifestyle modification showed superior outcomes.

Clear communication around “off-label repositioning” helped address regulatory queries efficiently.

Commercial Impact:

Product launched as a metabolic adjunct for women’s health.

Achieved ~22% market penetration in 12 months post-launch.

Received positive clinician feedback on metabolic markers.

Next Steps:

Explore fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of Metformin with inositols for enhanced ovarian function outcomes.
