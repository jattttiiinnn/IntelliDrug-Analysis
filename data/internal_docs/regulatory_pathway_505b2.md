Title: Regulatory Pathway – 505(b)(2) NDA Strategy

Date: March 2023

Overview:
The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway allows approval of drugs that rely in part on existing literature or prior findings, significantly reducing clinical development costs.

Typical Use Cases:

Drug repurposing (new indication for known molecule)

Modified dosage forms or routes of administration

Combination products with previously approved APIs

Advantages:

Accelerated approval timelines (typically 18–24 months).

Reduced need for full Phase III clinical programs.

Eligibility for 3-year market exclusivity for new clinical data submission.

Challenges:

Requirement for bridging studies demonstrating bioequivalence.

Patent certifications (Paragraph IV filings) can trigger litigation delays.

FDA expects strong justification for reliance on external studies.

Internal Learnings:
Our previous Metformin-PCOS submission succeeded due to clear literature bridging and proactive FDA consultation. For future GLP-1 analog repositioning, early alignment with the Office of New Drugs (OND) and submission of a pre-IND briefing package is recommended.

Expected Timeline: 18–22 months from submission to approval.
